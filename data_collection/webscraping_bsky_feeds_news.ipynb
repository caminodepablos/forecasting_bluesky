We launched the app publicly in February and gained over 23M users by the end of the year. With this growth came anticipated challenges in scaling Trust \\u0026#x26; Safety, from adding workstreams to adapting to new harms.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThroughout 2024, our Trust \\u0026#x26; Safety team has worked to protect our growing userbase and uphold our community standards. Our approach has focused on assessing potential harms based on both their frequency and severity, allowing us to direct our resources to where they can have the greatest impact. Looking ahead to 2025, we're investing in stronger proactive detection systems to complement user reporting, as a growing network needs multiple detection methods to rapidly identify and address harmful content. In Q1, we'll be sharing a draft of updated \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines\\\"\\u003eGuidelines\\u003c/a\\u003e as we continue adapting to our community’s needs.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOverview\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn 2024, Bluesky grew from 2.89M users to 25.94M users. In addition to users hosted on Bluesky’s infrastructure, there are over 4,000 users running their own infrastructure (Personal Data Servers), self-hosting their content, posts, and data.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTo meet the demands caused by user growth, we’ve increased our moderation team to roughly 100 moderators and continue to hire more staff. Some moderators specialize in particular policy areas, such as dedicated agents for child safety. Our moderation team is staffed 24/7 and reviews user reports around the clock. This is a tough job, as moderators are consistently exposed to graphic content. At the start of September 2024, we began providing psychological counselling to alleviate the burden of viewing this content.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eReports\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn 2024, users submitted 6.48M reports to Bluesky’s moderation service. That’s a 17x increase from the previous year — in 2023, users submitted 358K reports total. The volume of user reports increased with user growth and was non-linear, as the graph of report volume below shows:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ccenter\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/report-volume-2024.png\\\" alt=\\\"2024 report volume\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\" /\\u003e\\n  \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eReport volume in 2024\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003c/center\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn late August, there was a large increase in user growth for Bluesky from Brazil, and we saw spikes of up to 50k reports per day. Prior to this, our moderation team handled most reports within 40 minutes. For the first time in 2024, we now had a backlog in moderation reports. To address this, we increased the size of our Portuguese-language moderation team, added constant moderation sweeps and automated tooling for high-risk areas such as child safety, and hired moderators through an external contracting vendor for the first time.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe already had automated spam detection in place, and after this wave of growth in Brazil, we began investing in automating more categories of reports so that our moderation team would be able to review suspicious or problematic content rapidly. In December, we were able to review our first wave of automated reports for content categories like impersonation. This dropped processing time for high-certainty accounts to within seconds of receiving a report, though it also caused some false positives. We’re now exploring the expansion of this tooling to other policy areas. Even while instituting automation tooling to reduce our response time, human moderators are still kept in the loop — all appeals and false positives are reviewed by human moderators.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSome more statistics: The proportion of users submitting reports held fairly stable from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, 5.6% of our active users\\u003csup\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"#user-content-fn-1\\\" id=\\\"user-content-fnref-1\\\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\\\"footnote-label\\\"\\u003e1\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/sup\\u003e created one or more reports. In 2024, 1.19M users made one or more reports, approximately 4.57% of our user base.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn 2023, 3.4% of our active users received one or more reports. In 2024, the number of users who received a report were 770K, comprising 2.97% of our user base.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe majority of reports were of individual posts, with a total of 3.5M reports. This was followed by account profiles at 47K reports, typically for a violative profile picture or banner photo. Lists received 45K reports. DMs received 17.7K reports. Significantly lower are feeds at 5.3K reports, and starter packs with 1.9K reports.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur users report content for a variety of reasons, and these reports help guide our focus areas. Below is a summary of the reports we received, categorized by the reasons users selected. The categories vary slightly depending on whether a report is about an account or a specific post, but here’s the full breakdown:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAnti-social Behavior: Reports of harassment, trolling, or intolerance – 1.75M\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMisleading Content: Includes impersonation, misinformation, or false claims about identity or affiliations – 1.20M\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eSpam: Excessive mentions, replies, or repetitive content – 1.40M\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eUnwanted Sexual Content: Nudity or adult content not properly labeled – 630K\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIllegal or Urgent Issues: Clear violations of the law or our terms of service – 933K\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eOther: Issues that don’t fit into the above categories – 726K\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThese insights highlight areas where we need to focus more attention as we prioritize improvements in 2025.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eLabels\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn 2024, Bluesky applied 5.5M labels, which includes individual post labels and account-level labels. To give an idea of volumes, in Nov 2024, 2.5M videos were posted on Bluesky\\u003csup\\u003e\\u003ca href=\\\"#user-content-fn-2\\\" id=\\\"user-content-fnref-2\\\" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby=\\\"footnote-label\\\"\\u003e2\\u003c/a\\u003e\\u003c/sup\\u003e, along 36.14M images. This comes primarily from automation where every image as well as frames from each video is sent to a provider for assessment, they return verdicts that match to our specific labels, and those are the ones you see from Bluesky Moderation.

We’re excited to announce that we’ve raised a $15 million Series A financing led by Blockchain Capital with participation from Alumni Ventures, True Ventures, SevenX, Amir Shevat of Darkmode, co-creator of Kubernetes Joe Beda, and others.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur lead, Blockchain Capital, shares our philosophy that \\u003cstrong\\u003etechnology should serve the user, not the reverse\\u003c/strong\\u003e — the technology being used should never come at the expense of the user experience. Additionally, this fund has a uniquely deep understanding of our decentralized foundation and has extensive experience building developer ecosystems, so it’s a natural partnership as we continue to invest in the ATmosphere (the AT Protocol developer ecosystem). This does not change the fact that the Bluesky app and the AT Protocol do not use blockchains or cryptocurrency, and we will not hyperfinancialize the social experience (through tokens, crypto trading, NFTs, etc.). To ensure we and our users benefit fully from this expertise, partner Kinjal Shah will join our board. Kinjal shares our vision for a social media ecosystem that empowers the people who use it, and we are glad to have her support as we invest in driving the adoption of decentralized social.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWith this fundraise, we will continue supporting and growing Bluesky’s community, investing in Trust and Safety, and supporting the ATmosphere developer ecosystem. In addition, we will begin developing a subscription model for features like higher quality video uploads or profile customizations like colors and avatar frames. Bluesky will always be free to use — we believe that information and conversation should be easily accessible, not locked down. We won’t uprank accounts simply because they’re subscribing to a paid tier.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAdditionally, we’re proud of our vibrant community of creators, including artists, writers, developers, and more, and we want to establish a voluntary monetization path for them as well. Part of our plan includes building payment services for people to support their favorite creators and projects. We’ll share more information as this develops.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBluesky’s open technology, the AT Protocol, makes a whole ecosystem of apps possible. We’re excited that developers have already begun building their own applications with totally different purposes from the Bluesky app. For example, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://smokesignal.events/\\\"\\u003eSmoke Signal\\u003c/a\\u003e is an events app, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://frontpage.fyi/\\\"\\u003eFrontpage\\u003c/a\\u003e is a web forum, and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bluecast.app/\\\"\\u003eBluecast\\u003c/a\\u003e is an audio app (that includes karaoke with licensed songs)!

As Bluesky’s Head of T\\u0026#x26;S, my goal is to understand where the biggest gaps in user needs are and how to address them to ensure that people have a pleasant experience on Bluesky.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis is a big quarter for Trust and Safety at Bluesky, as we work on a large number of improvements. Here’s a preview of everything that is in progress!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eBan evasion and multi-account detection capabilities\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePeople deserve to have an experience free from harassment on Bluesky. While harassers can be infinitely creative in how they avoid detection, we’re working on tooling to reduce their impact. For example, we’re adding more friction to their ability to create new accounts. We currently register users for additional defenses when we see a pattern of new account harassment, but in the future, we'll be able to better detect and surface when multiple new malicious accounts are created and managed by the same user.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eToxicity detection experiments\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAddressing toxicity is one of the biggest challenges on social media. On Bluesky, the two areas that made up 50% of user reports in the past quarter are for content that is rude and for accounts that are fake, scams, or spam. Rude content especially can drive people away from forming connections, posting, or engaging for fear of attacks and dogpiles.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn our first experiment, we are attempting to detect toxicity in replies, since user reports indicate that is where they experience the most harm. We’ll be detecting rude replies, and surfacing them to mods, then eventually reducing their visibility in the app. Repeated rude labels on content will lead to account level labels, and suspensions. This will be a building block for detecting group harassment and dog-piling of accounts.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAutomating spam and fake account removals\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHarm on social media can happen quickly. For example, if a fake impersonation account asks for a fund transfer, it might take only a matter of minutes before someone falls for a scam. We’re launching a pilot project to automatically detect when an account is clearly fake, scamming, or spamming users to hopefully reduce the likelihood this happens. We’re hoping that this project, paired with our moderation team, can cut down the action time for these reports to within seconds of receiving a report.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFeedback on moderation reports\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn the coming months, we’re working to move away from communicating with users about violations via email to communicating through the Bluesky app. Users will receive notices of infractions or labels within the app. We’ll also send outcomes of your own reports through the app as well.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eGeography-specific labels\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn some cases, content or accounts may be allowed under Bluesky's Community Guidelines but violate local laws in certain countries. To balance freedom of speech with legal compliance, we are introducing geography-specific labels. When we receive a valid legal request from a court or government to remove content, we may limit access to that content for users in that area. This allows Bluesky's moderation service to maintain flexibility in creating a space for free expression, while also ensuring legal compliance so that Bluesky may continue to operate as a service in those geographies. This feature will be introduced on a country-by-country basis, and we will aim to inform users about the source of legal requests whenever legally possible.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDesigning video on Bluesky for safety\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe recently launched \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video\\\"\\u003evideo\\u003c/a\\u003e on Bluesky, and the T\\u0026#x26;S team has been working with the product team to ensure the feature is launched safely.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHere’s a look at how T\\u0026#x26;S works together with product. The product team puts together a document listing what they intend to build. Trust and Safety then assesses the risks associated with the feature, and makes recommendations to minimize harms that are most likely from that feature. This ensures that we anticipate harms and integrate mitigations before launch.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor video, Trust \\u0026#x26; Safety has incorporated various features like being able to turn off auto-play or ensuring that reports can be made and labels applied to content. You can read more about the available safety tooling for video \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe try to be pragmatic in building the safety elements that most people will need prior to launch, but there’s always room for more improvements in response to user feedback. So after a product launches, we pay close attention to reports and support requests as we improve the feature.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eList changes to restrict abuse\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eLists are a powerful way to have more control over your experience on Bluesky. You’re able to curate your favorite users, or to filter individuals out from your Bluesky experience — and to share those lists with others, so they can benefit from your curation as well.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHowever, sometimes bad actors use lists to harass others and violate our rules, so we’re making some changes. We have recently updated starter packs to remove members when blocked, and are doing the same for curated lists. Prior to this, the Bluesky Trust \\u0026#x26; Safety team has only been able to take down entire lists as a moderation action, instead of removing specific individuals. For moderation lists, this would mean that we’d unintentionally erase blocks. Now, when you block the creator of a list that you are on, you will get removed from the list.

Aqui você pode escolher a experiência social que mais te agrada.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNossa comunidade cresceu organicamente e está cheia de autores, artistas, jornalistas, políticos, entre outros. Os usuários brasileiros que já usam a plataforma notam que eles têm uma qualidade de engajamento com muito mais qualidade do que em qualquer outra plataforma.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAlém disso, o Bluesky é um ecossistema aberto. Nós criamos uma rede social aberta para que qualquer desenvolvedor seja capaz de modificá-la através do \\u003ca href=\\\"https://atproto.com/\\\"\\u003eAT Protocol\\u003c/a\\u003e (o nome dele é Atmosphere). Essa abertura diz respeito ao fato do Bluesky ser um projeto colaborativo, diferente de outras redes sociais que são controladas por uma única empresa. Qualquer um pode construir feeds, moderar e até criar aplicativos completamente novos usando a nossa plataforma.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eQuando o Bluesky vai liberar vídeos e trending topics?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOs vídeos já estarão disponíveis na nossa próxima grande atualização, e nós também já estamos trabalhando nos trending topics.

Por exemplo, caso você queira ver postagens dos seus amigos que não postam muito — tente \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.app/profile/why.bsky.team/feed/infreq\\\"\\u003eQuiet Posters\\u003c/a\\u003e. Caso queira ver o conteúdo mais postado no dia anterior em toda a plataforma, experimente o \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.app/profile/skyfeed.xyz/feed/catch-up\\\"\\u003eCatch Up\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eQualquer um pode criar e se inscrever nos feeds. Ao invés de providenciarmos apenas um algoritmo, nós deixamos nossos usuários escolherem. Você está no controle. Dessa forma a ideia é promover discussões mais saudáveis mesmo porque não incentivamos esquemas para aumentar engajamento, desinformação, fake news ou qualquer tipo de abuso.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eNomes de Usuário\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCaso você seja dono de um site, pode usar o nome dele como nome de usuário. Por exemplo, a Folha de S. Paulo escolheu usar \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.app/profile/folha.com\\\"\\u003e@folha.com\\u003c/a\\u003e como nome. Ah, mas não esqueça que você só pode usar o nome de usuário de um site que seja seu, pois essa é uma forma de mostrar que, por exemplo, você é a Folha de S. Paulo real. Esse é um jeito de se provar legítimo.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eVocê pode brincar e se divertir inventando! Por exemplo, muitas Swifties escolheram nomes de usuário que terminam com “swifties.social,” coisa que você pode configurar usando essa ferramenta \\u003ca href=\\\"https://swifties.social/\\\"\\u003eaqui\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCaso tenha interesse em comprar e gerenciar um site através do nosso parceiro Namecheap, você pode fazer isso \\u003ca href=\\\"https://account.bsky.app/\\\"\\u003eaqui\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eEstou cansado de criar contas novas em redes sociais!

Mas o Bluesky está aqui para ficar.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eQuando uma plataforma como o X fecha você perde contato com todos os seus amigos de lá. Mas como o Bluesky é uma rede cujo código é aberto você consegue levar seus seguidores com você. Dessa forma você sempre será capaz de manter contato com seus amigos. (caso esteja interessado em detalhes técnicos, tem mais informações sobre a portabilidade de contas \\u003ca href=\\\"https://atproto.com/guides/overview#account-portability\\\"\\u003eaqui\\u003c/a\\u003e.)\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eE digo mais! Por ser uma rede social aberta, desenvolvedores independentes podem construir aplicativos inteiramente novos e promover outras experiências a vocês. Imagine uma plataforma de blog ou um aplicativo de fotos nessa mesma rede com todos os seus amigos já conectados. Você não vai precisar se inscrever em outro aplicativo social desta vez — estará criando uma identidade social online que é apenas sua.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eComo o Bluesky lida com liberdade de expressão e moderação de conteúdo?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSegurança e promoção de espaços saudáveis para conversas é uma questão central para o Bluesky. Nosso time de moderação está de pé 24/7 e consegue responder a maioria das denúncias em poucos dias. Para denunciar uma postagem ou uma conta, simplesmente clique no menu indicado com três pontinhos e em “Denunciar Postagem” ou “Denúnciar Conta”.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAo mesmo tempo, nós entendemos que não existe uma única forma que sirva para moderar todos os espaços. Então, além da base sólida em relação às políticas de moderação do Bluesky, vocês podem se inscrever em outras organizações que confiem, ou mesmo em outras comunidades que tenham algum conhecimento específico e que podem adicionar regras de moderação.

Nosso time de moderação revisa o conteúdo ou a conta em busca de desinformação, coisa que os usuários podem denunciar diretamente do aplicativo. Em caso de violações severas como risco de boicotes a votação ou as eleições oficiais nós poderemos remover o conteúdo ou até a conta. Na maioria dos casos nós revisamos as reivindicações de que um conteúdo é falso buscando informações em fontes confiáveis e nos reservamos o direito de classificar postagens como desinformação.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eJornalistas podem entrar em contato através do \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:press@blueskyweb.xyz\\\"\\u003epress@blueskyweb.xyz\\u003c/a\\u003e.

Bluesky is here to stay.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen an app like X shuts down, you lose touch with all your friends there. But because Bluesky is built on an open network, you can easily take your followers with you. You will always be able to stay in touch with your friends.

Now, when you reply to an older thread of yours, it’ll get bumped to the top of your followers’ feeds. (You’ll no longer have to repost your own reply to surface it to your followers.)

No Bluesky, estamos investindo em segurança de duas formas. Primeiro, construímos nossa própria equipe de moderação dedicada a fornecer cobertura contínua para manter nossas diretrizes comunitárias. Além disso, reconhecemos que não existe uma abordagem única para a moderação — nenhuma empresa pode garantir a segurança online corretamente para todos os países, culturas e comunidades do mundo. Portanto, também estamos construindo algo maior — um ecossistema de moderação e ferramentas de segurança de código aberto que dá às comunidades o poder de criar seus próprios espaços, com suas próprias normas e preferências. Ainda assim, usar o Bluesky é familiar e intuitivo. É um aplicativo simples à primeira vista, mas por baixo do capô, habilitamos uma verdadeira inovação e competição nas mídias sociais ao construir um novo tipo de rede aberta.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eVocê pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation\\\"\\u003eaqui\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eO que a função de silenciar faz?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSilenciar impede que você veja quaisquer notificações ou postagens principais de uma conta.

The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders.

Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app.\\u003c/strong\\u003e This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAt Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines\\\"\\u003ecommunity guidelines\\u003c/a\\u003e. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn designing these moderation services, \\u003cstrong\\u003eBluesky operated by three principles\\u003c/strong\\u003e:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eSimple and Powerful:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Give users a pleasant default experience, with customization options under the hood\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eUser Choice:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Empower users and communities to develop their own moderation systems\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eOpenness:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Create an open system that increases trust in the governance of our digital spaces\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe first shared our vision for \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation\\\"\\u003ecomposable moderation\\u003c/a\\u003e before Bluesky even had 20,000 users last year. Now, we serve over 5 million users. In this blog post, we’ll dive into how moderation works on the network, where you can choose and customize all the pieces that make up your social media experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSensible Defaults with User Choice\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn everything we build, we aim to provide a polished user experience with further customization options for those you who want them. When you sign up for Bluesky, you will be subscribed to Bluesky’s built-in moderation service by default. This is similar to how custom feeds work on Bluesky — we’ll show you a couple feeds by default, but you can also create and subscribe to more. Bluesky’s moderation service combines around-the-clock coverage by our team to resolve user reports according to our \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines\\\"\\u003ecommunity guidelines\\u003c/a\\u003e with several automated moderation systems.

Starting this week, you'll have the power to install filters from independent moderation services, layering them like building blocks on top of the Bluesky app's foundation. This allows you to create a customized experience tailored to your preferences (see example below).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigure style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod-image-1.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"An example moderation service that users can subscribe to.\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" style=\\\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\\\"\\u003e\\n  \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eAn example moderation service that users can subscribe to.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn the first stage of this week’s rollout, these independent moderation services filters will be available on the desktop version of the app. Soon, they’ll also be available on mobile, so you can shape your social media experience across all platforms.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis hybrid approach is intended to provide a cohesive experience, where our in-house moderation works in conjunction with additional layers customized to each community. The Bluesky app, as an online space that we created and maintain, will always have the foundation of the moderation we provide.

If you get a jump scare from seeing spiders in your otherwise peaceful nature feed, you could install this moderation service and immediately any labeled spider pictures would disappear from your experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eModeration services can also accept reports, so if you came across an unlabeled picture of a spider, you could report it to the Spider Shield for review.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFrom a moderator perspective:\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIf you want to offer a moderation layer on top of what the Bluesky app provides, you can do this without running a lot of infrastructure or building your own client app. We’ve built open source software to simplify the process of running a moderation service. While you need some technical know-how for now, we expect this process to get simpler over time.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigure style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_ozone_ui.png\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" style=\\\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\\\"\\u003e\\n  \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eScreenshot of the Ozone interface, which a team can use to inspect and label content on the network.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003c/figure\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eToday, you can already run a mute list or block list that other users can subscribe to. But it often gets tied to your account in a way that makes it hard to delegate responsibility to others. Once you’re running a popular blocklist, that list becomes associated with your account, and users may start directly tagging you in the app. This can get overwhelming at scale.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOzone, the open source moderation labeling system we’re releasing today, lets you set up a service like a blocklist, but more nuanced — instead of just adding accounts, you can label specific posts too. You will have access to a reporting queue, and users will be able to send reports via the in-app reporting flow. You will be able to set custom labels, and specify what those labels should do. Moderation services will not be tied to individual users, and multiple people can manage them. Tooling designed for teams and communities can help take the burden off individuals and make it possible to run a sustainable moderation service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTo make this more concrete, let’s say you’re the creator of the previously mentioned Spider Shield labeler that labels photos of spiders. You can set up an Ozone dashboard that provides a queue of spider pictures that have been reported, reducing the need for people to tag you directly every time they find a new spider picture online. It’s customizable — you could create one kind of label that blocks pictures of real spiders, and one kind of label that blurs out illustrations of spiders. You could recruit others who don’t like spiders to help you manage the reports, and even hand the project off to someone else altogether without disrupting the people who are using it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eFrom a developer perspective:\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs a developer, you've got options when it comes to labeling content. You can use our software, like Ozone, or you can apply labels directly through the API. Ozone is built to help humans review moderation reports, but you can also use automated labeling to power your moderation services. Check out Ozone's open-source repo \\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIf you want to set up Spider Shield as a fully automated service that uses machine learning to find and label spider pictures, you can do that without even touching Ozone, our moderation tool. And if you want to customize Ozone for your own purposes, you can \\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone\\\"\\u003esubmit a PR\\u003c/a\\u003e or fork the project. Our goal in building this open source moderation tooling is to help apps in the AT Protocol ecosystem handle trust \\u0026#x26; safety challenges without having to start from scratch.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe generic, customizable nature of labels allows you to get creative with them — it would be possible to use labels to “verify” nature accounts that don’t post pictures of spiders, for example. Although the initial functionality of labelers is intended to hide, block, or blur content, it could eventually be used for curation or verification too. We think that the atproto developer ecosystem will find even more ways to use labels and independent moderation services, and will drive innovation in how moderation works on social networks.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eModeration services can work across the entire atproto network, not just the Bluesky app. Imagine if someone creates a new photo-sharing app called Skygram. The Spider Shield moderation service built for Bluesky could easily be used on Skygram too. That's the power of \\\"composable moderation\\\" — all the pieces can be mixed and matched in tons of different ways, even across completely separate apps.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe think it's important for Bluesky to lay the groundwork for a great experience in the app, which is why our moderation service is the default for all Bluesky app users. But we also believe in giving users the freedom to choose and the right to leave. So if Bluesky's moderation doesn’t meet your needs and you want an altogether different experience, you can make that happen. You'll need to build or use a different client app with your own moderation service, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up. However, all content shown in the Bluesky app must adhere to Bluesky’s community guidelines.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eFAQ\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eWhere can I find the open-sourced Ozone tool?\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou can find the GitHub repository\\n\\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eWhy are you open-sourcing Ozone?\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBy making Ozone open-source and providing it as a ready-to-use tool for independent moderators on the AT Protocol, we're creating a system that encourages collaboration and transparency. Unlike most social media companies that develop their safety tools in private, Ozone's development will be out in the open. This means that new social apps built on the AT Protocol can benefit from all the improvements made by Bluesky and other organizations. By working together and sharing knowledge, we can create better tools faster and build a social media ecosystem that works for everyone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eHow is this different from community moderation on Mastodon?\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eModeration on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. Our \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web\\\"\\u003epost on federation\\u003c/a\\u003e goes into more detail on how Bluesky differs from Mastodon.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eWhat do I need to do to moderate my own community on Bluesky?\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAll users of Bluesky’s client app are subscribed by default to Bluesky’s moderation. If you would like to run a moderation service that layers on top of these defaults, you can create a new account for that new service and get it up and running with Ozone.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHowever, if you want to opt out of our defaults, this is still possible — we believe it’s important to give users the right to leave and not lock you in. You would need to use or develop a separate client app that connects to the AT Protocol, but this option gives you full flexibility to implement your own moderation system from the ground up.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eHow will running a moderation service be sustainable?\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eModeration services, much like feed generators, will likely start off as community-run projects. Just like the 40,000+ custom feeds on Bluesky, or the many Mastodon instances that exist, they may continue to operate as independent projects of individuals or organizations. However, there is also nothing stopping a moderation service from having paid subscribers.\\u003c/p\\u003e\"},{\"title\":\"Bluesky: An Open Social Web\",\"date\":\"Feb 22, 2024\",\"summary\":\"We’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data.\",\"author\":\"The Bluesky Team\",\"path\":\"/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web\",\"bodyHTML\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eToday, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYour data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFederation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the \\u003ca href=\\\"https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation\\\"\\u003edeveloper blog\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSome of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky\\\"\\u003eusernames\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds\\\"\\u003efeeds\\u003c/a\\u003e. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eHow does this affect my experience on Bluesky?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eIf my experience doesn’t change, why federate?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com\\\"\\u003eAsk Jeeves\\u003c/a\\u003e?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eToday, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eDoes this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOn Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eA focus on the global conversation:\\u003c/strong\\u003e On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eComposable moderation:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eComposable feeds:\\u003c/strong\\u003e We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eAccount portability:\\u003c/strong\\u003e We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider — you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSo how can I self-host and join the network?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIt will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running.

This will allow other organizations and people to run their own moderation services that can account for industry-specific knowledge or specific cultural norms, among other preferences.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOne potential use case for labeling is fact-checking. For example, a fact-checking organization can run a labeling service and mark posts as “partially false,” “misleading,” or other categories. Then, users who trust this organization can subscribe to their labels. As the user scrolls through posts in the app, any labels that the fact-checking organization publishes will be visible on the post itself. This helps in the effective distribution of the fact-check and keeps users better informed.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you’re interested in partnering with Bluesky and setting up a labeling service, contact us at \\u003ca href=\\\"mailto:partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz\\\"\\u003epartnerships@blueskyweb.xyz\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eAn Open Social Network\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen you log in to Bluesky, it might look and feel familiar — the user experience should be straightforward. But under the hood, we’ve designed the app in a way that puts control back in your hands. Here, your experience online isn’t controlled by a single company. Whether it's your timeline or content filters, on Bluesky, you can easily customize your social experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThis month, we’ll be rolling out an experimental early version of “federation,” or the feature that makes the network so open and customizable. On Bluesky, you’ll have the freedom to choose (and the right to leave) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships can go with you.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor developers: We’ve already federated the network among multiple servers internally, and later this month, you’ll be able to self-host a server that connects to the main production network.

We’ll share more information on how to join the production network with your own server soon.

Any user can report content such as posts, accounts, or lists through the app. We then review reported content and behavior against both the \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/support/community-guidelines\\\"\\u003eCommunity Guidelines\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/support/tos\\\"\\u003eTerms of Service\\u003c/a\\u003e, and take action when appropriate.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur team of proactive and very-much-appreciated full-time moderators have provided around-the-clock coverage since spring. We’re doing things differently than a lot of social media sites, and hired our moderators directly, rather than relying on a third-party vendor. While we might use automated tools to handle reports in the future, right now every single report filed has been reviewed by humans, with no automated resolution. In 2023 we reviewed \\u003cstrong\\u003e358,165 individual reports\\u003c/strong\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_report_chart.png\\\" alt=\\\"chart of reports, by month, and by category\\\" width=\\\"750\\\" /\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigcaption\\u003eThe report categories in this graph  are based on the `com.atproto.moderation.defs#reasonType` schema. Currently, these categories do not clearly align with the in-app copy for reports. The categories shown in-app will be updated and harmonized soon. \\u003ca href=\\\"/images/blogposts/mod_2023_bsky_mod_reports_table.tsv\\\"\\u003eDownload the raw data as a TSV file here\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA relatively small fraction of accounts was responsible for creating the majority of reports, and separately a small fraction of accounts received the majority of reports. In total \\u003cstrong\\u003e76,699 individual accounts (5.6% of our active users) created one or more reports\\u003c/strong\\u003e, and \\u003cstrong\\u003e45,861 individual accounts (3.4% of our active users) received one or more reports\\u003c/strong\\u003e (either on the overall account, or on a piece of content created by the account).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen we take action on a report, our interventions have ranged from sending warning emails, to labeling, to takedowns of content or entire accounts. Takedowns can be either temporary suspensions or take effect permanently. While we used all of our interventions over the course of 2023, this post only includes a breakdown of takedowns: \\u003cstrong\\u003e4,667 accounts taken down\\u003c/strong\\u003e, and an additional \\u003cstrong\\u003e1,817 individual pieces of content taken down\\u003c/strong\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn addition to reports from the community, we have a number of automated tools to proactively detect suspicious or harmful conduct without a user first reporting it to the moderation team, such as slurs in handles and spam accounts. Some of these tools take direct action on visual content by applying labels like \\\"gore\\\" to violent imagery, while others simply file automated reports for human review. Users can appeal labels applied to their account through the same in-app reporting flow, which the moderation team will then take another look at. The numbers above do not include the large volume of reports created by our own automated systems.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eChild sexual abuse and exploitation, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), is obviously unacceptable anywhere on the Internet, including Bluesky. We built AT Protocol and Bluesky to ensure we can rapidly identify and remove this content anywhere it appears on our network, even when federation becomes available in the future. To help proactively detect, take down, review, and report CSAM to the applicable authorities (including NCMEC in the United States), we partnered with an established non-profit vendor who provides both hash matching APIs and specialist web apps for review and reporting. While any instance of this behavior is dangerous and warrants prompt action, to date we have thankfully not yet encountered a significant volume of such content in the network. However, our systems proactively identified four instances of potential CSAM, of which two were statistical false-positives, and two were confirmed to meet reporting requirements and were reported to NCMEC.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor this report, we are not yet including counts of legal requests and the fraction of requests serviced, nor are all of our moderation actions (such as labels) fully represented in the numbers we’ve shared here. We look forward to providing more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eInteraction Controls\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNo amount of reactive moderation will help if the base design of a product rewards abuse or inflames inter-community conflict. In 2023, we added a number of app and protocol features that give individuals and groups more control over their interactions in the network, with the aim of building safety options into the design of Bluesky itself.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eModeration lists can be used for muting and blocking. Individuals can maintain curated lists of accounts for an entire community, reducing duplicated efforts. Lists themselves are always public, and the behaviors of lists match the privacy of individual-level actions: blocking a list is public, while muting a list is private. Like all technical safety features, lists have both advantages and disadvantages as a moderation primitive. They can be a vector for harassment and abuse (and thus themselves require moderation), become difficult to maintain at larger scale, and have no built-in affordances for collaborative control or accountability. On the other hand, they are relatively familiar and easy to understand, have a low barrier to adoption, and integrate easily with everyday use of the app.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSelf-labeling of individual posts lets authors ensure appropriate content warnings are in place for viewers. This feature is currently limited to posts with visual images and adult content, but there is a clear path to expanding the scope to more labels.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ccenter\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_self_label_button_ui.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mobile app screenshot indicating self-labeling button\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\" /\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_self_label_ui.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mobile app screenshot of self-labeling config interface\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\" /\\u003e\\n    \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eThe self-labeling feature.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003c/center\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eReply controls give authors choice over who can interact in their threads, including the ability to close all replies to a post.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ccenter\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_threadgate_button_ui.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mobile app screenshot indicating reply control config button\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\" /\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_threadgate_post_ui.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mobile app screenshot of reply control config interface\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\" /\\u003e\\n  \\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_threadgate_ui.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"mobile app screenshot showing reply control notice box\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" style=\\\"display: inline;\\\" /\\u003e\\n      \\u003cfigcaption\\u003eThe reply controls feature.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003c/center\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThere are several more basic interaction controls in development or on the horizon. The ability to hide individual posts and to appeal labeling decisions on your own posts are both available now as beta-quality features. We are also tracking requests for the ability to mute keywords, and for users to be able to temporarily deactivate their own account. We’ll share more about these planned features in the coming months.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSupporting Tools and Infrastructure\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTrust and safety efforts rely on tooling — and a lot of our work has been building the supporting tooling and infrastructure for this work from scratch. We’ve made a lot of progress in 2023 behind the scenes to support our moderation teams and policies.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur moderation review tools have gone through major refactors and workflow improvements over the year, based on feedback from our moderators and policy experts. What started as a minimal admin interface can now handle tiered review queues, templated email workflows, moderation event timelines, and more. From a technical perspective, the APIs driving this system, both reporting and review, are defined the same way as other atproto endpoints, which supports interoperability with other alternative clients and workflow systems. We named the front-end interface of the moderation review system Ozone, and we plan to open-source it soon. We’re also in the process of pulling out the moderation back-end as a standalone service that other organizations can self-host.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/mod_2023_ozone_ui.png\\\" alt=\\\"screenshot of ozone web interface\\\" width=\\\"750\\\" /\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigcaption\\u003eScreenshot of the Ozone web interface, from a development environment.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eLastly, we have developed a rule-based automod framework to augment our moderation team when battling spam, and to proactively flag unacceptable content before it gets seen and reported by human users. This has helped identify some patterns of engagement farming and spam, and we will continue to develop and refine abuse detectors as we move towards open federation and growing the network.\\u003c/p\\u003e\"},{\"title\":\"A New Look for Bluesky: The Social Butterfly\",\"date\":\"Dec 21, 2023\",\"summary\":\"A new look for Bluesky — the social butterfly — and a public web interface.\",\"author\":\"Jay Graber\",\"image\":\"social-card-default.png\",\"path\":\"/blog/12-21-2023-butterfly\",\"bodyHTML\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eToday, we announced a new logo for Bluesky:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/brand-announcement-card.png\\\" alt=\\\"Bluesky's new logo: the social butterfly.\\\" /\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eWhy did we choose a butterfly?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWell, of course, it flies. But more importantly, it is a symbol of change and transformation. Early on, we noticed that people were organically using the butterfly emoji 🦋 to indicate their Bluesky handles. We loved it, and adopted it as it spread. The butterfly speaks to our mission of transforming social media into something new.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eLike a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, we are starting to open up. Posts on Bluesky have been public from the start through the open protocol, but today we’re making them publicly accessible through the app. We’re unfolding a little bit at a time, and are excited to bring you along on this journey of metamorphosis!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eWhat’s in a name?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe name “Bluesky” was originally a placeholder for the project started by Twitter to build an open social protocol. I decided to keep the name when I was chosen as the lead of the project. It’s memorable and symbolizes the open space of possibilities: the Twitter bird freed from a closed platform to fly in Bluesky’s open ecosystem.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/presentation-free-bird.png\\\" alt=\\\"The last slide of the presentation I gave to Twitter in my proposal for how to build Bluesky.\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" /\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigcaption\\u003eThe last slide of the presentation I gave to Twitter in my proposal for how to build Bluesky.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs the project matured, we named the underlying standard the AT Protocol, or atproto. Bluesky, as the more colorful (and less technical) name everyone was familiar with, is also what we named the first app we built on atproto. \\u003cstrong\\u003eBut Bluesky is not the limit.\\u003c/strong\\u003e Many more apps and experiences are already beginning to emerge — there are thousands of custom feeds, dozens of other clients, and atproto will eventually support other apps. We hope that Bluesky, as the first app, will be a catalyst for change and transform how social media works, like a butterfly flapping its wings.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003eWhat if I don’t like butterflies?\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe great thing about an open network is that anyone can build on top of it and customize it further! Maybe you like birds more. Well, someone could build BirdSky, and you could switch to using that and still be in the same network, still have the same friends, and still see the same posts.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe protocol that makes Bluesky, BirdSky, and endless other options possible is also what makes Bluesky “billionaire-proof.” Just like you can change email providers or cell phone carriers and bring all your contacts, photos, or messages with you, in an open network, you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eExplore Bluesky\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe built Bluesky to be a home for public conversation — breaking news, commentary and analysis, jokes and more.

If you don’t like our default Discover feed, you can simply remove it and replace it with any other custom feed.

This summer, we converted from a public benefit LLC to a public benefit C Corp in order to gain more independence from the legacy of the past. Our mission and board have stayed the same, but along with this conversion, we’ve raised funding from an array of values-aligned investors who share our vision for an open and decentralized commons for public conversation. Our goal for this raise was to find new partners and to give ourselves room to grow the network and experiment with new business models.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe raised $8M in a seed round led by \\u003ca href=\\\"https://neo.com/\\\"\\u003eNeo\\u003c/a\\u003e, a community-led firm with amazing partners like Ali Partovi and Suzanne Xie, and a wonderful cast of additional investors including Joe Beda who co-created Kubernetes, Bob Young of Red Hat, Amjad Masad of Replit, Amir Shevat of Darkmode, Heather Meeker, Mana Industries, Automattic, Protocol Labs, Katelyn Donnelly, Ali Evans, Stav Erez, Kris Nóva, Brad Fitzpatrick, Abdul Ly, and many other operators who have much wisdom to share.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWith this funding, we can expand our team, manage increasing operation and infrastructure costs, and grow the AT Protocol ecosystem as well as the Bluesky app. It’s a lot to tackle at once, but we’re excited to have seasoned allies who want to help us realize our vision of an open commons for public conversation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJust as we’ve made the source code for the protocol and the client public, we also want to be transparent about our business plans.

While advertising can subsidize services to make them free to the end user, it comes with negative long-term consequences like incentivizing platforms to lock their users in. In the business of advertising, where social media companies exchange user data to serve ads to specific audiences, users become the product.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBluesky’s business model must be fundamentally different — we are a public social network and our code is all open source, so we have no “moat” when it comes to data. We set out to build a protocol where users can own their data and always have the freedom to leave, and this approach means that advertising couldn’t be our dominant business model. So, we’ve been exploring other avenues of monetization.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe believe that there must be better strategies to sustain social networks that don’t require selling user data for ads. Our first step in another direction is paid services, and we’re starting with \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky\\\"\\u003ecustom domains\\u003c/a\\u003e. While setting up a custom domain to use with Bluesky and the AT Protocol is fairly straightforward, it does require some familiarity with domain registrars and DNS settings. Yet, over 13,000 users have already either repurposed domains they already owned to use as handles, or purchased a domain solely because of Bluesky. Domains have so much potential as a personalized way to customize identities and as a decentralized way to verify reputation that builds off the existing web. For example, U.S. Senators have used the \\u003ccode\\u003esenate.gov\\u003c/code\\u003e domain to verify their identity on Bluesky without our involvement, and a third-party developer built a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skylink-bluesky-did-detec/aflpfginfpjhanhkmdpohpggpolfopmb\\\"\\u003eweb extension\\u003c/a\\u003e that checks if websites are linked to an AT Protocol identity.

We don’t want to own people’s social graphs or communities. We want to be a tool that helps communities own and govern themselves.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe reason we focus on communities is that for an open commons to work, there needs to be some sort of structure that protects the people who participate. Safety can’t just be left up to each individual to deal with on their own. The burden this puts on people — especially those who are most vulnerable to online abuse and harassment — is too high. It also doesn’t mirror how things work in the real world: we form groups and communities so that we can help each other. The tooling we’re building for moderation tries to take into consideration how social spaces are formed and shaped through communities.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eToday, we’re publishing some proposals for new moderation and safety tooling. The first focuses on user lists and reply controls which can be used for community-driven moderation. The second will focus on moderator services and how they can handle problems that small communities can’t. The third is for Hashtags, which are not directly related to moderation but can have a large effect on customizing what you see.

In the rest of this post, we want to first share some insight into why we believe a public commons is important for social media.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhy build a public commons?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’re a public benefit company that was formed with the mission \\u003cem\\u003e“to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.”\\u003c/em\\u003e We believe that public conversations, which form the basis of a democratic society, should be held in spaces that can be a shared public commons.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA company is an efficient structure for building out a cohesive vision of how things should work, but locking users into our systems would be antithetical to our mission. An open commons can’t be governed at the sole discretion of one global company. We offer services like professional moderators so that we can help protect people and provide a good experience, but we shouldn’t exert total control over everyone’s experience, for all time, with no alternative. Users should be able to walk away from us without walking away from their social lives.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe reason we’re building in decentralization is because we observed that business interests and the open web have a habit of coming into conflict. Third-party developers often get locked out. Moderation policies come into conflict with the diverse interests and needs of different groups of users. Ads push towards algorithms that optimize for engagement. It’s a systemic problem that keeps playing out as centralized social media companies rise and fall.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSome might think this isn’t a big deal. Maybe social media is like a club, and the place can be happening one day and dead the next. Would it be so bad if people just moved on to the next joint...? The problem is that people put their lives and livelihoods into these networks. When a network shuts down, people lose out on a lot: they lose their connections, they lose their creative work, and they lose their places of business. Social networks are not just products; they’ve become digital homes.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eEven when things are working \\u003cem\\u003ecorrectly\\u003c/em\\u003e on social platforms, there are weird dynamics caused by people’s relationships being mediated by a single company. The Internet is pretty obviously real life in the sense that its management has real-world consequences. When these places control our identities and our ability to connect and to make money, having no way out from the founding company is a precarious situation. The power difference is daunting.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe goal of Bluesky is to rebuild social networking so that there’s not a lock-in to the founding company, which is us. We can try to provide a cohesive, enjoyable experience, but there’s always an exit. Users can move their accounts to other providers. Developers can run their own connected infrastructure. Creators can keep access to their audiences. We hope this helps break the cycle of social media companies coming into conflict with the open web.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat should this feel like?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSocial media has a reputation for being emotionally chaotic. Some days it can be fulfilling, and other days it can be a box of horrors. If we’re going to succeed in our mission of creating social media that operates as a sustainable public commons, these tools need to not just be good in theory, but actually help create a better social space than what has come before. Our goal for investing in moderation tooling and processes is to create a better public commons for conversations to take place in. Perhaps it can even be a happy, healthy, and predominantly \\u003cem\\u003eenjoyable\\u003c/em\\u003e space.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHere’s some of what we think it takes to create a great experience:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA great experience should be simple to use. It shouldn’t be overly complex, and there should be sensible defaults and well-run entry points. If things are going well, the average user shouldn’t have to notice what parts are decentralized, or how many layers have come together to determine what they see. However, if conflict arises, there should be easy levers for individuals and communities to pull so that they can reconfigure their experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA great experience should recognize that toxicity is not driven only by bad actors. Good intentions can create runaway social behaviors that then create needless conflict. The network should include ways to downregulate behaviors – not just amplify them.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA great experience should respect the burden that community management can place on people. Someone who sets out to help protect others can quickly find themselves responsible for a number of difficult choices. The tooling that’s provided should take into account ways to help avoid burnout.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA great experience should find a balance between creating friendly spaces and over-policing each other. The impulse to protect can sometimes degrade into nitpicking. We should drive towards norms that feel natural and easy to observe.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eA great experience should reflect the diversity of views within the network. Decisions that are subjective should be configurable. Moderation should not force the network into a monoculture.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFinally, a great experience should remember that social networking can be pleasant one day and harsh the next. There should be ways to react to sudden events or shifts in your mood. Sometimes you need a way to be online but not be 100% available.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat’s our development process?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDuring the private beta, we’ve been actively responding to user feedback. For example, based on user feedback, we recently introduced an optional “context” field to add a few lines of text to reports so that moderators can better understand issues that require more context to make a decision on. With these upcoming proposals, we’re looking for feedback ahead of time so we can get to the best outcomes quickly and prepare for opening up the network.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe proposals we’re publishing have been in the works for awhile; we focused on moderation and safety from the earliest moments of developing Bluesky and the AT Protocol, even if they didn’t always appear to be front and center. We’ve been fleshing out our ideas over the last few months through the practical experience of engaging with users during the Bluesky app’s beta. In designing these, we researched existing tooling implemented on other sites, discussed with users from different communities on the app, consulted with trust \\u0026#x26; safety advisors, and above all, constantly asked ourselves what tools would reduce harm, protect people, and decrease the likelihood of bad outcomes.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDecisions such as who has the right to speak or moderate an online space are intrinsically controversial. And it isn’t just about platforms making moderation decisions. For example, the ability to moderate replies to your own threads introduces complex tradeoffs around safety, counterspeech, and accountability. Replies are an area where some of the nastiest forms of abuse can happen, so we felt that per-thread moderation was a good idea. But there are downsides, too: For example, if a thread contains misinformation, then giving reply controls to the author means they might use it to suppress corrections from other users. Our hypothesis, reflected in the moderation proposals we’re sharing, is that giving users more tools to protect themselves from harassment is worth some downsides like not always having the record corrected in the replies.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’re presenting proposals for community discussion and developer feedback to help develop a rough consensus around these approaches — these tools won’t be effective unless people actually use them. They’re a set of tools that are meant to overlap, work together, and provide the building blocks for new ideas.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAn updated Community Guidelines\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn addition to working on moderation tooling, we’ve also been developing new policies and processes to moderate the services we run. As we explain in the community guidelines:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eBluesky Social is one service built on top of the AT Protocol. While we won’t always be able to control everything that happens on other services that use the AT Protocol, we take our responsibility to the users of Bluesky Social seriously. Our community guidelines are designed to promote a safe and enjoyable experience. To achieve this goal, we moderate the content on Bluesky Social, and you can also adjust content filters within the app according to your preferences.\\u003c/em\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAn important site of moderation is the servers themselves, and we want our policies to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for users who enter the network through our services. If the moderation tooling we’re building is like the building blocks and foundations of a city, the norms and policies we’re setting are how we’re actually going to run the city.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor the Bluesky servers we run (that is, the Bluesky app you’ve been using up to this point), we’re publishing updated Community Guidelines next week, linked to in our Terms of Service, which includes the following:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eTreat others with respect.\\u003c/strong\\u003e For example, no:\\n\\u003col\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eThreats of violence or physical harm, or content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies violence against people, groups, or animals\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eRepeated harassment or abuse directed at a specific person or group\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eEncouraging self-harm or suicide\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003ePromoting hate or extremist conduct that targets people or groups based on their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDepictions of excessive violence, torture, dismemberment, or non-consensual sexual activity\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMisleading impersonation of other individuals, organizations, or entities\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ol\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe actions that we take to enforce these guidelines will include removing individual posts and suspending and removing users from our services.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn the future, other services built on the AT Protocol might choose to adopt their own community guidelines that differ from ours. In a federated model, each server has discretion over what they choose to serve and who they choose to connect to. If you disagree with a server’s moderation policies, you can take your account, social connections, and data to another service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch1\\u003eProposals\\u003c/h1\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’ve created a new GitHub repository to host some of these proposals to streamline discussion.

If you move from one site to another, you have to start over with no history of the friends or content you created there. This is because the original web protocol made it easy to link websites, but had no built-in way to link people and their content, making it hard for people to maintain control over their online identities.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen a centralized platform owns your online identity and is the only host of your content, you’re vulnerable to getting cut off without warning. It’d be like if the city you lived in one day decided to kick you out, and there was no way to move your stuff to a new city and keep in touch with your friends. An analogy for what Bluesky is building is an identity and transport system between cities, so you can move from one place to another and keep your friends.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eBluesky’s goal is to rebuild social so that:\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eUsers own their data and can take it anywhere they want to go.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDevelopers will never get locked out of the ecosystems they help build.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eCreators will always own their relationships with their audience.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTo achieve these goals, Bluesky has developed a social protocol — in other words, we designed a new approach to storing and retrieving information about people in a social network. This is where the “decentralization” part of Bluesky comes in. A protocol is a set of instructions for computers to talk to each other. It creates a set of rules for how your data can move across different services, even ones not run by us. This open protocol is why most data – your posts, follows, likes, and blocks – is public on Bluesky right now. Making a post on Bluesky is like making a blog post you publish to the web. The underlying protocol for Bluesky is ATP, much like the underlying protocol for the web is HTTP. Our goal was to make social media work more like the open systems that defined the early web, like blogs and email.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eA Network of Cities\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eATP, or the Authenticated Transfer Protocol, is a federated social protocol. Here’s an analogy using cities in the real world to describe federation online: Centralized social platforms are like one big city that everyone lives in, and federated protocols are like a network of cities, of all different sizes. In the federated network, people can move between cities depending on what kind of community they’d like to be in. The Bluesky social app we’re running right now is just one city in a network that will grow over time. The AT Protocol gives you a passport (identity) to travel with, and lets you take all of your belongings (data) with you, enabling an eventual network of cities to interoperate. When we launch federation, more cities (servers) will pop up.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJust as different cities can have different laws and cultures, different parts of a federated network can be governed differently. Systems like\\u003ca href=\\\"/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation\\\"\\u003e composable community moderation\\u003c/a\\u003e can help create a system for governing the different “cities” in the network. In the future, we hope to see many new and different kinds of cities (i.e. other social apps like dating apps or video feeds) get built by users and developers, as well as the bridges and tunnels that connect these cities. With your Bluesky passport, you can travel freely between digital spaces, with the tools to create your own or to curate your experience at home. We believe that the future of social media is co-created and open. Join us!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eThis blog post is written for a general audience.

At Bluesky, we’re investing in safety from two angles. First, we've built our own moderation team dedicated to providing around-the-clock coverage to uphold our community guidelines. Additionally, we recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to moderation — no single company can get online safety right for every country, culture, and community in the world. So we’ve also been building something bigger — an ecosystem of moderation and open-source safety tools that gives communities power to create their own spaces, with their own norms and preferences. Still, using Bluesky feels familiar and intuitive. It's a straightforward app on the surface, but under the hood, we have enabled real innovation and competition in social media by building a new kind of open network.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYou can read more about our approach to moderation \\u003ca href=\\\"https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat does muting do?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMuting prevents you from seeing any notifications or top-level posts from an account.

To make public conversations portable across all sorts of platforms, your data is stored in data repositories that anyone can view. This means that regardless of which server you choose to join, you’ll still be able to see posts across the whole network, and if you choose to change servers, you can easily take all of your data with you. This is what causes the user experience of Bluesky, a federated protocol, to be similar to all the other social media apps you have used before.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eCan I set my profile to be private?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCurrently, there are no private profiles on Bluesky.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eWhat happens when I delete a post?\\u003c/strong\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAfter you delete a post, it will be immediately removed from the user-facing app. Any images attached to your post will be immediately deleted in our data storage too.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHowever, it takes a bit longer for the text content of a post to be fully deleted in storage.

The AT Protocol, a federated networking model which Bluesky is built upon, changes this.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSoon, we’re launching a sandbox environment to begin the testing phase of federation for the AT Protocol with allow-listed servers.

(Technically, the lower-level primitives that can get stacked together differently are the \\u003ca href=\\\"https://atproto.com/guides/overview\\\"\\u003erepositories, lexicons, and DIDs\\u003c/a\\u003e.) This means that the architecture we’re proposing for launching federation is not the only network architecture that’s possible – it’s just what we expect to be the most powerful and robust way of supporting public conversations on a global social network, so we implemented it first.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/federation-architecture-diagram.png\\\" alt=\\\"Diagram of federation architecture\\\" width=\\\"600\\\"\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe three main services of our first federation are personal data servers (PDS), relays, and App Views.

This is what hosts your data (like the posts you’ve created) in your \\u003ca href=\\\"https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos\\\"\\u003erepo\\u003c/a\\u003e.

It crawls the network, gathering as much data as it can, and outputs it in one big stream for other services to use. It’s analogous to a firehose provider or a super-powered relay node.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eApp Views\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAn App View is the piece that actually assembles your feed and all the other data you see in the app, and is generally expected to be downstream from a Relay's firehose of data. This is a highly semantically-aware service that produces aggregations across the network and views over some subset of the network. This is analogous to a prism that takes in the Relay's raw firehose of data from the network, and outputs views that enable an app to show a curated feed to a user. For example, the Relay might crawl to grab data such as a certain post’s likes and reposts, and the app view will output the count of those metrics.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/app-view-prism.png\\\" alt=\\\"The App View visualized as a prism\\\" width=\\\"600\\\"\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigcaption\\u003eBase image of prism: Wikimedia Commons\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe federation architecture allows anyone to host a Relay, though it’s a fairly resource-demanding service. In all likelihood, there may be a few large full-network providers, and then a long tail of partial-network providers. Small bespoke Relays could also service tightly or well-defined slices of the network, like a specific new application or a small community.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThere will also be an ecosystem of App Views for each lexicon, or “social mode,” deployed on the network. For example, Bluesky currently supports a micro-blogging mode: the \\u003ccode\\u003eapp.bsky\\u003c/code\\u003e lexicon. Developers who create new lexicons would likely deploy a corresponding App View that understands their lexicon to service their users. Other lexicons could include video or long-form blogging, or different ways of organizing like groups and forums. By bootstrapping off of an existing Relay, data collation will already be taken care of for these new applications. They need only provide the indexing behaviors necessary for their application.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003e“Big World” Design\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhen we were architecting the topology of the AT Protocol, we looked at the web as an example. We see the web as the most successful decentralized system in existence — millions of devices globally connected on an open network — so we’re taking it as a null hypothesis of what works best.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs a result, we opted to architect the protocol in a “big world with small world fallbacks” way. With the web, individual computers upload content to the network, and then all of that content is then broadcasted back to other computers. Similarly, with the AT Protocol, we’re sending messages to a much smaller number of big aggregators, which then broadcast that data to personal data servers across the network. Additionally, we solve the major problems that have surfaced from the web through \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol\\\"\\u003eself-certifying data, open schematic data and APIs, and account portability\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOn a technical level, prioritizing big-world indexing over small world networking has multiple benefits.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIt significantly reduces the load on PDSs, making it easier to self-host — you could easily run your own server.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIt improves discoverability of content outside of your immediate neighbors — people want to use social media to see content from outside of their network.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIt improves the quality of experience for everyone in the network — fewer dropped messages or out-of-sync metrics.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eGiven all that, our proposed methodology here of networking through Relays instead of server-to-server isn’t prescriptive. The protocol is actually explicitly designed to work both ways.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat’s Next For Us\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe strongly believe that for federation to matter, all the pieces must be easy for you to set up. When we launch our sandbox environment publicly, we’ll provide straightforward instructions.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eMeanwhile, we’re working on two more pieces of federation: \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice\\\"\\u003efeed generators\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/blog/4-13-2023-moderation\\\"\\u003elabelers\\u003c/a\\u003e. Currently, Bluesky’s App View generates some “opinionated” data (as in, it differentiates between pieces of data, unlike a giant firehose of data), like the feeds that we show users and the labels we use in content moderation. But we’re experimenting with splitting feed generators and labelers out as services of their own, and when that’s complete, anyone may host a feed generator and advertise it to users in the marketplace of algorithms.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFrom a technical perspective, here’s one potential architecture: A feed generator can exist downstream of some Relay and App View, where the feed generator is constrained to offering “candidates” for the feed. Then, the App View presents the actual view of that data to the user.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSimilarly, a labeler would also be downstream of a Relay. Its labels would then be ingested by either an App View or a semantically-aware PDS.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eSandbox Mode\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe will be initially launching federation in sandbox mode with allow-listed servers. This means we’ll be running it in a staging environment that gets reset at least once a week, allowing the network to test it out before going live with all existing user data. Having a sandbox environment is very useful, as it will allow us and all developers in the ecosystem to stress-test and debug the system. The sandbox environment we’ve set up can be used to test out future major protocol changes as well. You can participate in the sandbox as a developer or a user — just be aware that things will break, and your data will get wiped!\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe sandbox environment is also useful to us as we finish building out our moderation and curation tooling. Before we open federation entirely, we want to provide other servers with the same toolbox that we’re using to curate a safe social media experience, and developers can also build more moderation tools on top of atproto themselves.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’ll be sharing more soon about moderation, and about how to start experimenting with the sandbox environment.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch4\\u003eUpdate: Join the atproto federation developer sandbox \\u003ca href=\\\"https://atproto.com/blog/federation-developer-sandbox\\\"\\u003ehere\\u003c/a\\u003e!\\u003c/h4\\u003e\"},{\"title\":\"How to verify your Bluesky account\",\"date\":\"Apr 28, 2023\",\"summary\":\"Here's how to verify your Bluesky account by setting your website as your username.\",\"author\":\"Emily Liu\",\"path\":\"/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial\",\"bodyHTML\":\"\\u003cp\\u003eOn Bluesky, you can set your website as your username.

But it’s much easier to remember \\u003ccode\\u003ebsky.social\\u003c/code\\u003e instead of a series of numbers. The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like a phonebook for the internet and points a domain like \\u003ccode\\u003ebsky.social\\u003c/code\\u003e to its IP address, so we don’t have to remember the numbers ourselves.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDomains can be further divided into subdomains. For example, if your domain was \\u003ccode\\u003eexample.com\\u003c/code\\u003e but you had a blog hosted at \\u003ccode\\u003eblog.example.com\\u003c/code\\u003e, then \\u003ccode\\u003eblog\\u003c/code\\u003e is the subdomain.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhy does Bluesky use domains as usernames, and why would I want to do this?\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe AT Protocol, which the Bluesky app is built upon, was designed to use domains for multiple reasons:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eIdentity:\\u003c/strong\\u003e Bluesky is just one application built on top of the AT Protocol.

Image generated by Midjourney.\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eModeration is a necessary feature of social spaces. It’s how bad behavior gets constrained, norms get set, and disputes get resolved. We’ve kept the Bluesky app invite-only and are finishing moderation before the last pieces of open federation because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eJust like our approach to algorithmic choice, our approach to moderation allows for an ecosystem of third-party providers. Moderation should be a composable, customizable piece that can be layered into your experience. For custom feeds, there is a basic default (only who you follow), and then many possibilities for custom algorithms. For moderation as well, there should be a basic default, and then many custom filters available on top.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe basics of our approach to moderation are well-established practices. We do automated labeling, like centralized social sites, and make service-level admin decisions, like many federated networks. But the piece we’re most excited about is the open, composable labeling system we’re building that both developers and users can contribute to. Under the hood, centralized social sites use labeling to implement moderation — we think this piece can be unbundled, opened up to third-party innovation, and configured with user agency in mind. Anyone should be able to create or subscribe to moderation labels that third parties create.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eAn Ecosystem of Moderation Labeling\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHere’s the way we’re designing an open, composable labeling system for moderation:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAnyone can define and apply “labels” to content or accounts (i.e. “spam”, “nsfw”). This is a separate service, so they do not have to run a PDS (personal data server) or a client app in order to do so.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eLabels can be automatically generated (by third-party services, or by custom algorithms) or manually generated (by admins, or by users themselves)\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAny service or person in the network can choose how these labels get used to determine the final user experience.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSo how will we be applying this on the Bluesky app? Automated filtering is a commoditized service by now, so we will be taking advantage of this to apply a first pass to remove illegal content and label objectionable material. Then we will apply server-level filters as admins of bsky.social, with a default setting and custom controls to let you hide, warn, or show content. On top of that, we will let users subscribe to additional sets of moderation labels that can filter out more content or accounts.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eLet’s dig into the layers here. Centralized social platforms delegate all moderation to a central set of admins whose policies are set by one company. This is a bit like resolving all disputes at the level of the Supreme Court. Federated networks delegate moderation decisions to server admins. This is more like resolving disputes at a state government level, which is better because you can move to a new state if you don’t like your state's decisions — but moving is usually difficult and expensive in other networks. We’ve improved on this situation by making it easier to switch servers, and by separating moderation out into structurally independent services.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’re calling the location-independent moderation infrastructure “community labeling” because you can opt-in to an online community’s moderation system that's not necessarily tied to the server you're on.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eCommunity Labeling\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eCommunity labeling can be done by automated systems, or it can consist of humans manually labeling things. The human-generated label sets can be thought of as something similar to shared mute/block lists.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHere’s how we think a manual community labeling system will work:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAnyone can create a label set, then add admins or mods to help manage it\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eMods can add labels that the set defines to accounts or content (“rude”, “troll”, etc.)\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAnyone can subscribe to the set and have the labels be applied to their experience\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eWhat's Ahead\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’re landing a first pass on automated filtering in the app today, and will improve it based on user feedback. Community labeling is still in the works. We’ll be publishing more details soon.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThrough this approach of a composable, customizable moderation system, we aim to prioritize user safety while giving people more control.

In this blog post, we’ll provide an overview of our motivation behind creating a system that enables composable, customizable feed generation, and embraces third-party development.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eOwning your attention\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eYour attention is an invaluable resource. A social platform's algorithm is responsible for curating the content in your feed. The algorithm, more than the content type or the app's appearance, is the core of social media because it directs how you spend your attention there.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eUnfortunately, there’s usually very little transparency into how things are selected or why content is being shown to you. While you have the choice to open or close a social app, you often lack control over the content you see while using it. You might have some control over their feed through choosing who to follow or selecting a chronological feed option, but your ability to truly customize your experience is limited.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDue to the backlash against the perceived algorithmic manipulation of people’s timelines, some people say they really just want a chronological feed of who they follow. A feed of content from the people you follow ordered only by time is also an algorithm (albeit a very simple one). This should be an option if you want, but we think there are also many more ways this could work. The problem isn’t “algorithms” — the problem is a lack of transparency and control around how algorithms are used to direct your attention.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eA Marketplace of Algorithms\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe want a future where you control what you see on social media. We aim to replace the conventional \\\"master algorithm,\\\" controlled by a single company, with an open and diverse \\\"marketplace of algorithms.\\\"\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWith the AT Protocol v1 launch around the corner, we can confidently share our vision for this marketplace. Algorithms in ATP will act as aggregator services, similar to search engines. Users will be able to find, share, and add algorithms to their clients. Our UX design allows users to swipe between favorite algorithms or view a multi-algorithm feed.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eHere’s how we’ve started building towards a world where users have control over what they see:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDeveloping APIs for feed generation:\\u003c/strong\\u003e These APIs will be architecturally separate from the rest of the system, allowing for custom feed and moderation systems to be created as independent services.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\u003cstrong\\u003eDesigning interfaces for third-party algorithm selection:\\u003c/strong\\u003e We’re developing a feed selection system that enables users to explore third-party feeds and access them as effortlessly as their home timeline.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor developers, an open marketplace of algorithms will provide the freedom to experiment with and publish algorithms that anyone can use. Recent advances in machine learning will make it easy and exciting to experiment with new ways of structuring content.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFor users, the ability to customize their feed will give them back control of their most valuable resource: their attention. Life is made up of all the little moments you spend your time on. We hope that the future of social apps is a framework that allows you to express your agency over how you spend your time.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWhile feed algorithms and search are the primary focus here, we’re using a similar approach to address reputation, misinformation labeling, and moderation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur goal is to assemble a social media architecture that composes third-party services into a seamless user experience, because an open ecosystem is likely to evolve more quickly than a single approach to curation or moderation developed within one company. By creating the interfaces for innovation in these areas, we hope to provide a dynamic and user-driven social experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\"},{\"title\":\"Domain Names as Handles in Bluesky\",\"date\":\"Mar 6, 2023\",\"summary\":\"Today we got our first custom domain name handle registered on Bluesky.

Last year we open sourced \\u003ca href=\\\"/about/blog/10-18-2022-the-at-protocol\\\"\\u003ethe AT protocol\\u003c/a\\u003e, a foundation for next generation social apps that can bring back the openness and creativity of the early web.

We expect the app to serve as a reference client for developers to learn how to build on atproto, as well as a landing place for users to see how a decentralized social app can be pleasant to use, customizable, performant, and safe. While we could’ve built the protocol in isolation, we knew we needed to work with real users to build pragmatic specs. We built an app to drive protocol development through product learnings, and chose a very simple microblogging format to show how Twitter could have been built on atproto (the AT protocol).\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur focus right now is on finishing atproto and surfacing its novel features in the app. Here’s what you can expect to see in the next few months:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eDomain names as usernames \\u0026#x26; account portability\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eComposable moderation \\u0026#x26; reputation systems\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eAlgorithmic choice \\u0026#x26; custom feeds\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’ll write more about each of these features as they get introduced. The app is currently invite-only while we finish pieces that we believe to be critical — in particular the moderation system. We want to enable people to have a safe, enjoyable experience, so we’re regulating growth and building moderation tooling as a first-order feature and not as an afterthought.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe believe decentralization is a means to end. The end goal is to provide choice to users, freedom to developers, and control to creators. The AT Protocol is a fresh start for social because it creates a composable ecosystem where the convenience and scale of centralized services can be combined with the openness and resilience of decentralized protocols.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs a user, you can create an account and use our Bluesky app with few recognizable differences from using a centralized social app. However, if you decide you want to host your own server, or have a username that’s your personal website, you can also switch over to doing that. If you don’t like the way we show you posts or moderate your experience, you can switch services without losing your friends or data, or swap out your feed or moderators though a plugin ecosystem.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs a developer, you can freely build apps on atproto (AT Protocol) because open protocols are locked-open APIs. However, if you just want to introduce another way of showing people posts, or moderating content in the network, we are designing interfaces for you to plug in and do exactly that, accessible through our app. If you’re building a new social app, you’ll be able to tap into the social graph and interest graph of atproto users the way you are currently able to bootstrap off of a user’s phone contacts.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eAs a creator, you’ve probably invested a lot of time building an audience on social platforms, but you always want to keep an email list of subscribers because email is an open protocol that a platform can’t take away from you. The promise of building an audience on apps built on atproto is that long term, it should become a protocol like email that lets you keep direct connections with people regardless of how the services mediating that relationship change.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003c/ul\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePeople have been saying for years that it would be great if users could own their data and their relationships; if we could have transparent algorithms and algorithmic choice; if there could be more accountability and user control over how social platforms are moderated. We’ve been wanting this for years too. We’ve now designed and built a system that we think achieves the goals stated above. We’re excited for the future of social we’re building towards, and hope you join us on this journey of bringing an open, self-governing ecosystem to life.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003chr\\u003e\\n\\u003cul\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003etimelines fuzzy, but feel free to watch our \\u003ca href=\\\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto\\\"\\u003eprogress on GitHub\\u003c/a\\u003e or \\u003ca href=\\\"https://matrix.to/#/#bluesky-dev:matrix.org\\\"\\u003ejoin our dev chat in Matrix\\u003c/a\\u003e.\\u003c/li\\u003e\\n\\u003cli\\u003eIn August 2023, the Bluesky team transferred ownership of the Matrix chat to the Matrix team.

There are many projects that have created protocols for decentralizing discourse, including \\u003ca href=\\\"https://activitypub.rocks/\\\"\\u003eActivityPub\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://scuttlebutt.nz\\\"\\u003eSSB\\u003c/a\\u003e for social, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://matrix.org/\\\"\\u003eMatrix\\u003c/a\\u003e and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\\\"\\u003eIRC\\u003c/a\\u003e for chat, and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\\\"\\u003eRSS\\u003c/a\\u003e for blogging. While each of these are successful in their own right, none of them fully met the goals we had for a network that enables global long-term public conversations at scale.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSome of the most important objectives we have been evaluating are portability, scale, and trust. Portability allows people to keep their social life intact even if they switch providers. Scale allows people to participate in global discourse. And trust is created by giving people insight into what services are doing with their data and how information is being promoted into or removed from their feed. To dive a bit deeper into each topic:\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003ePortability\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePortability is the ability to move between services without losing everything, like how we can switch mobile carriers without losing our phone numbers. User choice requires portability for identity, data, payments, and any other service. When people can switch providers without losing their identity or social graph, then social media can work as a competitive open market again.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWith email, if you change your provider then your email address has to change too. This is a common problem for federated social protocols, including ActivityPub and Matrix. If your ActivityPub server shuts down, you lose your identity and relationships tied to your account on that server, just like you would if any other social platform shut down. Since ActivityPub servers are much smaller than the existing platforms, and often run by volunteers, this scenario is not unlikely and has \\u003ca href=\\\"https://indieweb.org/witches.town\\\"\\u003ehappened before\\u003c/a\\u003e. We want users to have an easy path to switching servers, even without the server’s help.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eScale\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSocial networking platforms bring hundreds of millions of people together in a global conversation. Some people prefer smaller communities, and ActivityPub and SSB are great for those tight-knit groups, but with Bluesky we want to give users the option to participate in global conversations the way they do on large social networking platforms.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOperating at scale requires engineering for scale. Early on, Twitter’s site crashed so often that the \\u003ca href=\\\"https://business.time.com/2013/11/06/how-twitter-slayed-the-fail-whale/\\\"\\u003e“fail whale”\\u003c/a\\u003e became a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fail-whale\\\"\\u003ememe\\u003c/a\\u003e. They’ve since \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2021/processing-billions-of-events-in-real-time-at-twitter-\\\"\\u003esolved\\u003c/a\\u003e \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2017/the-infrastructure-behind-twitter-scale\\\"\\u003ethese problems\\u003c/a\\u003e, but existing decentralized networks that try to replicate the functionality of big platforms have not. When you search a trending hashtag on social media and find posts from around the world or see a viral post that has 125k likes, this is the service providing you with a global view across the network while hiding the complexity under the hood. By decentralizing aspects of social platforms, we’re adding cross-organizational networking that re-exposes the complexity. A protocol for conversations at scale needs to be developed around these challenges at every step.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDecentralization adds new functionality in other domains, but when it comes to scale, we’re aiming to replicate the global experience that social networking platforms currently offer. Existing decentralized social protocols default to local conversations because it’s a natural fit for a decentralized architecture, but our goal is to make global conversations possible while preserving the freedoms users gain from interacting through an open protocol.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch2\\u003eTrust\\u003c/h2\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eDecentralized networks are complex. Providers need to manage spam and abuse without inadvertently creating biases which lose the trust of their users. This is even more important for the algorithms that drive our feeds. Social media has the power to shape cultural discourse and needs to exist within a system of checks and balances. Like scale and portability, we aim to build around trust from the start by exposing what’s going on under the hood and allowing users to adjust their experience.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eStarting as centralized platforms, social networks can take steps to open up APIs and provide choices to users, and this can be a path towards restoring trust in the current service. The premise of Bluesky, however, is to work towards a transparent and verifiable system from the bottom up by building a network that is open by default. We’ll do this by giving users ways to audit the performance of services and the ability to switch if they are dissatisfied.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003chr\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe conceptual framework we've adopted for meeting these objectives is the \\\"self-authenticating protocol.\\\" In law, a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902\\\"\\u003e“self-authenticating” document\\u003c/a\\u003e requires no extrinsic evidence of authenticity. In computer science, an \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/gpads.pdf\\\"\\u003e“authenticated data structure”\\u003c/a\\u003e can have its operations independently verifiable. When resources in a network can attest to their own authenticity, then that data is inherently \\u003cem\\u003elive\\u003c/em\\u003e – that is, canonical and transactable – no matter where it is located. This is a departure from the connection-centric model of the Web, where information is host-certified and therefore becomes \\u003cem\\u003edead\\u003c/em\\u003e when it is no longer hosted by its original service. Self-authenticating data moves authority to the user and therefore preserves the liveness of data across every hosting service.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe three components that enable self-authentication are \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\\\"\\u003ecryptographic identifiers\\u003c/a\\u003e, \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage\\\"\\u003econtent-addressed data\\u003c/a\\u003e, and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_computing\\\"\\u003everifiable computation\\u003c/a\\u003e. The first two are familiar concepts in distributed systems, and the third is an emerging area of research that is not yet widely applied, but that we think will have large ramifications.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eCryptographic identifiers\\u003c/em\\u003e associate users with public keys. \\u003ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity\\\"\\u003eSelf-sovereign identity\\u003c/a\\u003e is based on having cryptographic identifiers for users. Control of an account is proved by a cryptographic signature from a user, rather than an entry in a database keeping track of logins.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eContent-addressed data\\u003c/em\\u003e means content is referenced by its cryptographic hash — the unique digital “fingerprint” of a piece of data. Using public keys and content-addresses, we can sign content by the user's key to prove they created it. Authenticated data enables trust to reside in the data itself, not in where you found it, allowing apps to move away from client-server architectures. This creates “user-generated authority”.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003eVerifiable computation\\u003c/em\\u003e uses cryptographic proofs to allow observers to verify that a computation was performed correctly without having to run it themselves. This can be used to preserve privacy by concealing inputs, as in a zero-knowledge proof, or to compress state that would otherwise have to be kept around for verification. The full potential of these cryptographic primitives is still being explored. Cutting edge research is currently being applied to scaling blockchains, but we are also investigating novel applications in distributed social networks.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003chr\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eNow that we've explained self-authenticating protocols, let's look at how the components help us achieve our goals.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003ePortability is directly satisfied by self-authenticating protocols. Users who want to switch providers can transfer their dataset at their convenience, including to their own infrastructure. The UX for how to handle key management and username association in a system with cryptographic identifiers has come a long way in recent years, and we plan to build on emerging standards and best practices. Our philosophy is to give users a choice: between self-sovereign solutions where they have more control but also take on more risk, and custodial services where they gain convenience but give up some control.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSelf-authenticating data provides a scalability advantage by enabling store-and-forward caches. Aggregators in a self-authenticating network can host data on behalf of smaller providers without reducing trust in the data's authenticity. With verifiable computation, these aggregators will even be able to produce computed views – metrics, follow graphs, search indexes, and more – while still preserving the trustworthiness of the data. This topological flexibility is key for creating global views of activity from many different origins.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eFinally, self-authenticating data provides more mechanisms that can be used to establish trust. Self-authenticated data can retain metadata, like who published something and whether it was changed. Reputation and trust-graphs can be constructed on top of users, content, and services. The transparency provided by verifiable computation provides a new tool for establishing trust by showing precisely how the results were produced. We believe verifiable computation will present huge opportunities for sharing indexes and social algorithms without sacrificing trust, but the cryptographic primitives in this field are still being refined and will require active research before they work their way into any products.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003chr\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn this post, we’ve started to lay out the high level objectives we’ve set and how we plan to meet them. In the coming weeks, we’ll be publishing more of the research we’ve done since the ecosystem review and open sourcing preliminary code. We’ve started writing code to validate ideas and iterate on something concrete, but everything is still fully experimental. You can expect a command line client to play with, but don’t expect to build your next big app on it yet, as anything can change at this stage.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe’re not describing what we’re building as a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://medium.com/decentralized-web/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53\\\"\\u003efederated or p2p network\\u003c/a\\u003e, or as a \\u003ca href=\\\"https://medium.com/decentralized-web/blockchain-social-networks-c941fb337970?source=user_profile---------4-------------------------------\\\"\\u003eblockchain network\\u003c/a\\u003e, because it doesn’t fall neatly in any of these categories.

In the meantime, the bluesky community took shape and has taken on a life of its own. There now exists two separate organizations, the bluesky community and Bluesky PBLLC. We’ve been using lowercase “bluesky” to refer to the original open-ended project, and uppercase “Bluesky” to refer to the company with that namesake.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch1\\u003eThree phases\\u003c/h1\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eBluesky began with an idea, developed into a community, and solidified into a company, in three stages. The formation of Bluesky, PBLLC at the end of 2021 marked the beginning of the most recent stage, where we now have funding and an organization to pursue our mission.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePhase 1: The idea\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe bluesky project began with a tweet by Jack Dorsey announcing Twitter’s intentions to fund the development of an open protocol for decentralized social media. Many people DM’ed the new bluesky Twitter account to learn more, including myself. Twitter brought about a dozen of us together in a Matrix chatroom, and that was the beginning of the initial discussions of what bluesky should be.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/how-it-started-chatroom.png\\\" alt=\\\"how-it-started-chatroom.png\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigcaption\\u003eThe first bluesky community chatroom\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn an initial Q\\u0026#x26;A in that room, Jack wrote \\u003cem\\u003e“The biggest and long term goal is to build a durable and open protocol for public conversation. That it not be owned by any one organization but contributed by as many as possible. And that it is born and evolved on the internet with the same principles.”\\u003c/em\\u003e This resonated with us. Twitter’s support for this was exciting, because of all the people who already use it as a platform for public conversation, but we also knew this needed to be independent from Twitter to succeed.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eTwitter’s creation of that Matrix room was partly an experiment in self-organization, to see if the direction and leadership of bluesky would emerge from that community. Many people were generous with their time in contributing insight to the discussions, including Jeremie Miller (inventor of \\u003ca href=\\\"https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/\\\"\\u003eXMPP\\u003c/a\\u003e who is now on the Bluesky board), Matthew Hodgson (technical co-founder of \\u003ca href=\\\"https://matrix.org/\\\"\\u003eMatrix\\u003c/a\\u003e), Ian Preston (co-founder of \\u003ca href=\\\"https://peergos.org/\\\"\\u003ePeergos\\u003c/a\\u003e), and rabble (early Twitter engineer and co-founder of \\u003ca href=\\\"https://www.planetary.social/\\\"\\u003ePlanetary\\u003c/a\\u003e). However, around the same time the bluesky community chatroom was created, COVID-19 was beginning to take the world by storm. 2020 threw organizations and personal lives into chaos. Midway through the year, I proposed writing an \\u003ca href=\\\"https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/README.md\\\"\\u003eecosystem overview\\u003c/a\\u003e of existing decentralized social networks.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cimg src=\\\"/about/images/blogposts/how-it-started-overview.png\\\" alt=\\\"how-it-started-overview.png\\\"\\u003e\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cfigcaption\\u003eA diagram from the ecosystem overview\\u003c/figcaption\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe created a bigger version of the bluesky chatroom that grew to around 60 people, and I started writing an overview of all the projects in the space. The ultimate shape of the bluesky project remained undetermined, but the bluesky community was starting to connect people to talk across projects and building up a collective knowledge base in the form of the ecosystem review.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePhase 2: The community\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eSometime in 2020, Twitter put out a request for proposals to the community group. Several of us wrote technical proposals on how we thought a novel decentralized social protocol could work, either building on existing protocols or starting from scratch. In 2021, Twitter interviewed people for the role of bluesky lead, and ended up nominating me. I say nominating rather than hiring, because rather than starting to work for Twitter, I started spinning up an independent organization that would receive funding to make bluesky a reality.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eI knew there was going to be a lot of press when I was publicly announced as bluesky lead, but I didn’t have anywhere to direct people yet, so I asked Golda Velez to help with opening up the bluesky community to anyone interested in joining. Her side project was a social events startup that could help cover the costs of hosting and moderating a public community until the Bluesky company got set up. On the day of the announcement, we launched a blueskyweb.org site that I put together, and a bluesky Discord* and \\u003ca href=\\\"https://blueskycommunity.net/\\\"\\u003eblueskycommunity.net\\u003c/a\\u003e site that Golda put together. We discussed how to best channel the enthusiasm of newcomers in a productive direction, and decided to direct energy into core topics and existing projects. This ended up creating a lively forum for debate and discussion, becoming a unifier for once disparate conversations.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003ch3\\u003ePhase 3: The company\\u003c/h3\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eIn the last few weeks of 2021, we got the Bluesky PBLLC established and funded. We decided to keep the community as a separate organization, funded through grants from the Bluesky company, so it can function as an inclusive forum while the company pursues more focused research and development. At the Bluesky company we want to start being more public, having more conversations with companies besides Twitter, and engaging with other protocols, but first we need to finish hiring and articulate the technical vision for our proposed direction. In the meantime, the community continues to be a place for discussion and debate, where we participate but do not drive conversations.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003e\\u003cem\\u003e* Update: In the spring of 2022, this Discord server was renamed to dSocial Commons.

Since then, the bluesky community has been working together to better understand the existing \\u003ca href=\\\"https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/README.md\\\"\\u003edecentralized web ecosystem\\u003c/a\\u003e, and outline the core tenets of what an open protocol for social media should include and the technologies on which it should be built.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eToday, we are excited to announce the formation of the Bluesky PBLLC, a Public Benefit LLC that will implement that vision as an independent organization. \\u003cem\\u003eOur mission is to develop and drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open and decentralized public conversation.\\u003c/em\\u003e We were formed in late 2021 with the initial funding provided by Twitter. Our board members include Jack Dorsey, a founder of Twitter, Jeremie Miller, the inventor of Jabber/XMPP, and Jay Graber, CEO of the Bluesky company.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eWe envision an open social media ecosystem where developers have more opportunity to build and innovate, and users have more choice and control over which services they use and their experience on social media as a whole. The development and adoption of decentralized protocols is a path we see towards establishing a strong technical foundation for permissionless innovation and user choice. Decentralization is a structural change that in itself is insufficient for creating a healthy social media ecosystem. However, by creating an environment where developers can freely build, communities can self-govern, and users can easily switch services, decentralization can catalyze the innovation necessary to improve the public conversation.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eThe many existing decentralized social networks that currently make up the ecosystem can be categorized into \\u003ca href=\\\"https://medium.com/decentralized-web/decentralized-social-networks-e5a7a2603f53\\\"\\u003efederated and p2p architectures\\u003c/a\\u003e. Our approach will be to combine the best of both worlds by integrating the portability of \\u003ca href=\\\"https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81\\\"\\u003eself-certifying protocols\\u003c/a\\u003e with the user-friendliness of delegated hosting, so users don’t have to run their own infrastructure and developers can build performant apps. Moderation is an important part of any online social forum, which is why we will proactively build tooling for reputation and moderation systems that are transparent, opt-in, and multi-layered, as well as create frameworks for others to build such tooling. We’re building on existing protocols and technologies but are not committed to any stack in its entirety. We see use cases for blockchains, but Bluesky is not a blockchain, and we believe the adoption of social web protocols should be independent of any blockchain.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\n\\u003cp\\u003eOur current focus is on building and releasing a prototype that illustrates our approach. Stay tuned for news about our new team members soon.
